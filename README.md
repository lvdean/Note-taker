## Description
This week task was to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. The application used an Express.js back end, it saved and retrieved note data from a JSON file.

## User Story
As a small business owner I want to be able to write and save notes
So that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

## Tasks

- On the landing page the user will click on the link to the notes page. They are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
- When the user enters anew not title and the note's text a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page.
- The new note user enetered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes, and the buttons in the navigation disappear.
- When the user clicks on the the save button, the new note entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear.
- When the user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation.
- When the user clicks on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page, there will be empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears.
- When the user clicks on the delete button, the saved note will disappear from the lef-hand column.
